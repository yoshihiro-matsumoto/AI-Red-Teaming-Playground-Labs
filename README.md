# AI Red Teaming Playground Labs

This repository contains the challenges for the labs used in the course "AI Red Teaming in Practice". The course was originally taught at [Black Hat USA 2024](https://www.blackhat.com/us-24/training/schedule/index.html#ai-red-teaming-in-practice-37464) by [Dr. Amanda Minnich](https://www.amandaminnich.info/) and [Gary Lopez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-l-76501814a). [Martin Pouliot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-pouliot-266ab0105/) handled the infrastructure and scoring for the challenges. The challenges were designed by Dr. Amanda Minnich, Gary Lopez and Martin Pouliot. These challenges are available for anyone to use. The playground environment is based on [Chat Copilot](https://github.com/microsoft/chat-copilot) and was modified to be used in the course.

These challenges are also referenced in the [Microsoft Learn Limited Series: AI Red Teaming 101](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/ai-red-team/training), released on July 9, 2025. In the table of challenges below, you will find the relevant video link to each challenge from the series. During Microsoft Build in May 2025, several of these challenges were automated by the [Python Risk Identification Tool (PyRIT)](https://aka.ms/pyrit), which is an open-source framework built to empower security professionals and engineers to proactively identify risks in generative AI systems. This repository contains the [corresponding Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Red-Teaming-Playground-Labs/tree/main/notebooks) showcasing how to use PyRIT to solve the challenges for Labs 1 and 5. You will also see a notebook for "Lab 13", which does not have an associated challenge as it is notebook-only.

## What You Will Learn
These challenges are designed to teach security professionals to systematically red team AI systems. They go beyond traditional security failures by incorporating novel adversarial machine learning and Responsible AI (RAI) failures, enabling a holistic approach to identifying potential issues before an AI system is deployed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- **Option 1:** [Azure OpenAI Endpoint](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service) endpoint with an api-key
- **Option 2:** [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to use the standard OpenAI API
- For Azure OpenAI: An Azure Foundry deployment named `text-embedding-ada-002` using the model `text-embedding-ada-002`, as well as the model you intend to use. Ex: `gpt-4o`

### Configuration

#### Option 1: Using Azure OpenAI (docker-compose.yaml)

You can set the environment variables for the Azure OpenAI endpoint in the `.env` file. Please use the `.env.example` file as a template.

#### Option 2: Using Standard OpenAI API (docker-compose-openai.yaml)

If you prefer to use the standard OpenAI API, you need to configure the following environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export OPENAI_TEXT_MODEL="gpt-4o"  # or the model of your choice
export OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL="text-embedding-ada-002"
export AUTH_KEY="your-auth-key"
export SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
```

### Running the Playground Labs

#### Option 1: With Azure OpenAI

The easiest way to run the playground labs is to use the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file included in this repository. This will start all the components needed to run the playground environment with a set of 12 challenges.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

#### Option 2: With Standard OpenAI API

To use the standard OpenAI API instead of Azure OpenAI, use the `docker-compose-openai.yaml` file:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-openai.yaml up
```

### Accessing the Challenges

Once the challenges are running you can access them using the following url: `http://localhost:5000/login?auth=[YOUR-AUTH-KEY]`. 

On macOS you will need to access `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login?auth=[YOUR-AUTH-KEY]` because localhost maps to IPv6 and the containers are listening on IPv4.

### Changing the Challenges

If you would like to change the challenges, you can do so by changing the `challenges/challenges.json` file. This file contains the description of the challenges and their objectives. You can then use the script `generate.py` to generate the new docker-compose file with the new challenges and their configuration.

```
cd challenges
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python generate.py challenges.json
```

## Components

The playground environment uses the following components:

### Mandatory Components

- **challenge-home**: The landing page for the playground environment. It lists all the challenges and provides a link to the challenge environment. In the BlackHat course, this landing page was not used. The challenges were listed in the CTFd platform. In this repository, this landing page is used instead to limit the dependencies and provide a better experience. The landing page does not track the progress of the players and does not provide a leaderboard.
- **chat-copilot**: This is the main component of the playground environment. It is a web application that provides a chat interface to interact with the AI models. It's heavily based on the [Chat Copilot](https://github.com/microsoft/chat-copilot) project. This component can be configured for multiple different challenges. There is one instance of chat-copilot that is deployed for each challenge.

### Optional Components

- **ctfd**: CTFd is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform that is used to host the challenges. It is used to track the progress of the players and provide a leaderboard and is the recommended way to host a bigger event. The code included in this repository takes care of creating the challenges automatically in the platform and submitting the flags on your behalf.
- **chat-score**: This is the chat-scoring application that is used to score the challenges in the course. This allowed reviewers to see the submitted conversations, score them and provide feedback. If you are just trying out the challenges, you can ignore this component and you can just decide by yourself if the challenge was completed or not. This application needs to be used with CTFd since that's how the flags are submitted. In this repository, this application is not used. The code is included in the repository for reference.
- **picture-submission**: This is an application that is used to submit pictures. This component was used for the labs that required submitting a picture that was genearated by an AI model. This component would send pictures to the chat-score component to be scored. This component is not used in this repository. The code is included in the repository for reference.
- **loadbalancer**: This is a load balancer that was used to round-robin the requests to multiple Azure OpenAI Endpoints. This component was created so it could take advantage of the headers provided by this API on how many requests were remaining. This way we could increase the system's capacity and not be rate limited by a single endpoint. This component is not used in this repository. The code is included in the repository for reference.

## Deployment

Originally, these challenges were deployed in Kubernetes in Azure. The Kubernetes deployment files are included in the repository for reference. They are located in the `k8s` folder. The deployment was done with the help of the deploy.py script. This script would use the Kubernetes template and make the required changes for which challenges we needed to deploy based on a single JSON file that contained the challenge description.
